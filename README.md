# Limo
*Lowly Image Organizer*

## About

Limo is a simple tool allowing you to

1. easily arrange images so they have the desired order;
2. copy and rename the images after a given filename pattern.

This way, albums of images are created where images stay in order in any file system through the use of sortable, 
unified filenames.

## Scenario

* Drag & drop photos from various sources into Limo window
* Click *Sort by Date/Time* of exposure (Tools menu)
* Select one or more images and move to correct their position
* Insert other photos and images and move them to the desired position as well 
* Save as new album
* Click *Copy and Rename* (from Tools menu), select filename pattern, e.g. `IMAG_{000N}_{NAME}`
