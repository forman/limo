# Limo
*Lowly Image Organizer*

## About

Limo is a simple tool allowing you to

1. easily arrange images so they have the desired order;
2. copy and rename the images after a given filename pattern.

This way, albums of images are created where images stay in order in any file system through the use of sortable, 
unified filenames.
